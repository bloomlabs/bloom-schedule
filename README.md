# Bloom Schedule - API


## About
Bloom Schedule (working name) is a simple PHP-based web app designed to be used as an easy way for members and staff to create, modify and remove bookings for the two meeting rooms currently residing in the Bloom Lab. It's split into two seperate components; an API for data minipulation and a web front-end.

## Goals
Eventually the goal is to have a screen either mounted on the wall or placed near the meeting rooms allowing Bloom Lab members and staff to identify current and scheduled meetings, their duration and if the room is free or not. Users can then proceed to a web page on their personal devices to create, modify or remove their own bookings.

## API Documentation
